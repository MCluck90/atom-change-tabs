# Change Tabs

I've always enjoyed changing tabs with the `ctrl` key, like in most modern browsers. This package allows you to do that.

Note: This is available on Mac by default by using &#8984; + 1, &#8984; + 2, etc.

### Default Mapping

```
ctrl-1 -> 1st tab
ctrl-2 -> 2nd tab
ctrl-3 -> 3rd tab
...
ctrl-0 -> 10th tab
```
